# AO-Face-Detector

A python program that detects faces from both camera and files.

It shows a green square around the face when the person is wearing a mask and a red square when someone is not wearing the mask / is not wearing it properly.

For best results, use surgical masks, but other types should work as well.

Detailed documentation in Polish is presented in the [Dokumentacja.pdf](Dokumentacja.pdf) file.

## Genesis
